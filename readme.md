# Predict-The-Category-Of-The-News-Article.

In this project we will prdecit the type of article form the data set by using four different classification model to find out which give the optimium result to best fit in the projcet.

The category of the news item:\
b : business\
t : science and technology\
e : entertainment\
m : health

The four classification model:\
1-> Multinomial Naive Bayes\
2-> Logistic Regression\
3-> Random Forest\
4-> Decision Tree

We will also try to increse the accurcay of the model by using the k-fold validation technique and find best term co-related to each label using chi squared test.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

What things you need to install:-\
Jupyter Notebook\
Python 3.6 or above version\
Sklearn\
Pandas

## Running the tests

Run the file with extension '.ipynb' in the jupyter notebook.

## Result

Multinomial Naive Bayes model perfom the best as the accuracy achived my the model is good and the time required to train the model is very less as compared to other models.
